# projet-grocereaz

This is my end of studies project: in a team of four students, we had to design and code a website. I was the product owner, and part of the frontend team. We used React for the front and Symfony for the back. Grocereaz displays recipes coming from an external API and enables the connected user to save his favorite recipes and to generate grocery lists from the recipes he would like to cook.

The original repo is on the Github account of the school, and is private. I created a copy on my Github account to make it public.
